# Code Style and Design

This README is for both main collaborators only (Shayer and Jody). Not to be confused with README required for Orbital

Coding style implemented will be similar to Google coding style with the following key features:
- Every class will have it's own Dart file
- Every page will have it's own Dart file (except home page which will be designed in main.dart)
- After creating new Dart file, create a widget tree (image from dart.io) according to the uplaoded dart file in the respective issue to make it more understandable to the other party 
- As much as possible, create functions and classes privately (prefixed with an _ )
- Since there's only 2 of use, discuss merge conflicts (privately if its a long conflict) and meet up to resolve conflicts
